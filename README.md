## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
lm_model = lm(Class_num ~ Duration, data=GermanCredit)
coefs = coefficients(lm_model)
intercept = coefs[1]
slope = coefs[2]
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginner to intermediate-level data scientists, undergraduate to masters-level students, and early to mid-senior data scientists or analysts looking to expand their knowledge of machine learning by exploring various R libraries. Basic knowledge of linear algebra and data modeling is a must.
